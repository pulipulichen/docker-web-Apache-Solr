The hoard deposits have been excavated in their in situ contexts, providing much more information than the isolated plough soil finds discovered with metal detectors.

Climate chamber investigation of the effect of indoor thermal histories on thermal adaptation in different seasons,Yuxin Wu =  Angchen Jiang =  Hong Liu =  Baizhan Li =  Risto Kosonen,"Energy and built environment, 2024, Vol.5 (3), p.455-463",,Cold acclimation =  Hot summer and cold winter =  Skin temperature =  Thermal comfort =  Thermal experience,,,"The indoor thermal history of residents in the hot summer and cold winter climate zone in China have undergone a significant change in recent years, which also changes their seasonal thermal adaptations and this has formed feed-back effects to the increasing usage of air conditioning units in this area. To study the seasonal variations of thermal adaptation, the thermal comfort experiments were conducted on two groups of participants. Each groups included 20 participants who had indoor history mainly with natural ventilation (NV group) and air-conditioning (AC group), respectively. The results demonstrated that the thermal sensation vote (TSV) in warm environments did not differ between AC and NV subjects in summer. However, the TSV of AC subjects were much lower than that of NV subjects in the same standard effective temperature and skin temperature in a cold environment in winter. Overall, the participants who spent most of their time in AC space in winter showed a low level of thermal adaptation with a narrower acceptable skin temperature range of 32.6 – 33.5 °C. Thus, this study presents the basic information regarding the seasonal effects on human thermal adaptation due to different long-term indoor thermal histories.",,,,,"KeAi Communications Co., Ltd",,,,,DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals,,EISSN: 2666-1233= DOI: 10.1016/j.enbenv.2023.02.002,,,,,,,,,,,,https://uco-tku.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/886UCO_TKU/u57elj/cdi_doaj_primary_oai_doaj_org_article_fb9875c1b6ab413887754a9fb978c674

Grantz et al. (2011), and contains a brief, but comprehensive compilation of geological and
geophysical data characterizing all significant sedimentary successions in the Arctic, which
cover 57% of the polar area north of 64°N. Two main goals have been designated: (i) to
provide, based on the present-day knowledge and data, a characterization of all Arctic
sedimentary successions (or sedimentary accumulations), and (ii) to supply a snapshot of
hydrocarbon-related exploration in the Arctic at the end of the second decade of this
millennium. To achieve these goals, we represent sedimentary successions as consisting of
one or several “Tectono-Sedimentary Elements” (TSE). This concept allows delineation,
mapping, and characterization of 9 categories of TSEs based of main tectonic regimes that
formed accommodation space.
A TSE characterization template has been developed as an efficient method of organising
and presenting the most important information about stratigraphy, structure, and
petroleum geology of a TSE, including most significant exploration facts. This organizationa architecture is the backbone of the volume and is a key feature that distinguishes it from
other similar works about the sedimentary basins.",,,,,Geological Society,,,,,NORA - Norwegian Open Research Archives,,ISSN: 0435-4052= ISSN: 2041-4722= DOI: 10.1144/M57-2021-30,,,,,,,,,,,,https://uco-tku.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/886UCO_TKU/u57elj/cdi_cristin_nora_10037_24580

However, little remains known about the extent to which DGC affects tourist behavior. Based on a temporal construal-level research framework, which considers how the level at which a stimulus is construed influences consumers' information processing and decision-making, this study investigates the interplay effects of temporal distance and post type on tourists' attitude strength changes (Study 1) and decision-making processes (Study 2) from a dynamic approach. The findings reveal that the effect of DGC on tourists' attitude changes is contextual, and DGC is less influential on tourists' decision-making processes when they have a near travel plan than a distant one. This study significantly changes the current understanding of the scope of DMOs’ influence through social media, concluding that DMOs should not invest in DGC except for in specific contexts.",,,,,Elsevier Ltd,,,,,Elsevier ScienceDirect Journals,,ISSN: 0261-5177= EISSN: 1879-3193= DOI: 10.1016/j.tourman.2023.104844,,,,,,,,,,,,https://uco-tku.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/886UCO_TKU/u57elj/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_tourman_2023_104844

In this article, we focus on the task of monolingual retrieval in a variety of typologically diverse languages using such an architecture. Although recent work with multilingual transformers demonstrates that they exhibit strong cross-lingual generalization capabilities, there remain many open research questions, which we tackle here. Our study is organized as a “best practices” guide for training multilingual dense retrieval models, broken down into three main scenarios: when a multilingual transformer is available, but training data in the form of relevance judgments are not available in the language and domain of interest (“have model, no data”); when both models and training data are available (“have model and data”); and when training data are available but not models (“have data, no model”). In considering these scenarios, we gain a better understanding of the role of multi-stage fine-tuning, the strength of cross-lingual transfer under various conditions, the usefulness of out-of-language data, and the advantages of multilingual vs. monolingual transformers. Our recommendations offer a guide for practitioners building search applications, particularly for low-resource languages, and while our work leaves open a number of research questions, we provide a solid foundation for future work.",,,,,,,,,,Alma/SFX Local Collection,,ISSN: 1046-8188= EISSN: 1558-2868= DOI: 10.1145/3613447,,,,,,,,,,,,https://uco-tku.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/886UCO_TKU/u57elj/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1145_3613447
